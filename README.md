# Finance Planner

## Company Backgroud

Being a startup FinTech consultancy firm, and I want to make a difference by working on projects with high social impact in local communities. Having won your first contract to help one of the biggest credit unions in my area. 

This project is to create a tool to help credit union members to enhance their financial health. It includes building a prototype application developed for Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of the credit union to demo in the next credit union assembly.

The solution includes two financial analysis tool to assess the monthly personal finances, and forecast a reasonably good retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds for the credit union board members.

- The **personal finance planner** that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.
- The second tool will be a **retirement planning tool** that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. 
- And use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.


Financial analysis utilizes two APIs to simulate real time forecasting:

-   The **Alpaca Markets API** will be used to pull historical stocks and bonds information.
-   The **Alternative Free Crypto API** will be used to retrieve Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.

Have a wonderful finance planning analysis!
