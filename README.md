- The first will be a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.
- The second tool will be a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. You will then use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.


Financial analysis built utilizes two APIs to simulate real time forecasting:

-   The Alpaca Markets API will be used to pull historical stocks and bonds information.
-   The Alternative Free Crypto API will be used to retrieve Bitcoin and Ethereum prices.
